## Solution

The URL tells us we are looking for a WiFi network named Vango24.

Wigle is a good resource to locate wireless networks and where they map back to. This can be used for WiFi, Cell, and Bluetooth. By searching for a SSID named "Vango24" in Wigle we find a match that provides some coordinates of its location.

When we go to the coordinates provided from the Wigle search, we can see two cars parked on the street. One is a black Nissan and the other is a blue Saturn.

At first I tried just the car brand, but you need to include the model.

```
flag{Saturn Ion}

Similar to the "Caller ID" challenge this one has a hint worth negative points. Players should use the hint to gain overall points for the competition.
