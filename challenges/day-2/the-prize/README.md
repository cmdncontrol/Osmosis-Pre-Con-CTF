## Solution

I uploaded the image to Google Lens to see what sport these rings may be connected to.

Cheerleading seemed to be a likely sport based on the results and the fact that world wide competition do exists for the sport at all levels. 



I located a website, https://cheertheory.com/, that seemed to track the world competitions for cheer. I was able to find the results from both 2014 and 2011. I began looking at both pages to see who won in both years. I could easily narrow it down to an international team based on the description of the challenge, only one team matched up on both years.
