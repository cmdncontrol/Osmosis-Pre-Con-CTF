# Jams

## Description

If I wanted to listen to some of the Jams playing for the last two days, what URL would I need to visit to find this particular list? 
(may or may not be direct link to playlist) 



## Solution

In the discord for the association there was a "Stage" channel where Will was playing jams consistently. Since Will was hosting the music in that channel I began searching for any music application profiles that he owned. I located a Youtube account for Will with a Techno playlist that matched the videos which were playing. 

[Techno Work List - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLBcnKr-7GjoA0e2NM0duqIqMjZpu3ItJ)



I tried submitting this link as many different ways as possible without prevail. 

The description notes it may not be a direct link to a playlist, so I went up a level to his profile which was the proper flag.
