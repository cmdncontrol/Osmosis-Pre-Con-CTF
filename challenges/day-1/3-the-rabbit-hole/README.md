# The rabbit hole

## Description

You've heard of the Fanta$tic 5 but how about the Majestic 5. Make your way through the rabbit whole and find the creator. 

## Solution

If you follow the link it brings you to a "hacked" association page. At the very bottom of the page you can enter the "rabbit hole" which seems to just be a list of sponsors for the conference. After scrolling through this it seemed like a dead end. I shifted to googling the hint in the description for the "majestic 5" and "OSINT" which revealed a name I saw in the rabbit hole. Majestic 5 seems to be part of RAKIA which is a sponsor.
